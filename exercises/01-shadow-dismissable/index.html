    <h1>The Boring Content Store</h1>
    
    <div class="dismissable">Here at the boring content store, we have lots of boring
      content. In fact, we have so much boring content that you'll probably go insane
      if you don't get rid of it.</div>
    
    <div class="dismissable" title="Spectacularly Boring">You may be wondering, why fill
      a store with so much boring content? We'd let you know the answer, but that would
      actually be a little bit interesting, so instead we won't.</div>
    
    <div>This content is boring, but you'll just have to live with it. No dismissal!</div>
